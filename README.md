# `contented`

This is a django project for delivery of data-analysis results (notebooks,
tables etc) in a user-authorised way: Only those users with access to a given
project should be able to view it's deliverables.

To use `contented`: fork the repository, add your analysis deliverables to the
`projects` subdirectory and then pull the modified repository onto a web-server
(details follow).

## Note

This is my first (non-tutorial) Django project. So there may be much better
ways of achieving the project's goals.
