# Questions and Answers

## ?? Non-authorised user cannot see projects that require authorisation

Want to have a functional test that does the following:

- Add an authorised user to the Users table
- Add a non-authorised user to the Users table
- Define a restricted project
- Define a non-restricted project

- Check that an unlogged-in user:
    - cannot see a restricted project, but can see an open project
    - cannot open any URL associated with a restricted project
    - can open a URL associated with an open project

- Check that an authorised user:
    - can see both restricted projects and open projects
    - can open a restricted project's URL

- Check that a non-authorised user:
    - cannot see a restricted project
    - cannot open any URL associated with that project

Therefore, need a test database for this test

### ?? Setting up a test database for use in Functional Tests

Initial functional test used `unittest.TestCase` and was ran using
`unittest.main()`. This is somewhat limited: it uses whatever database is
available to it, and it requires that the django server is running in the
background.

Here we require a test database, so we use django's LiveServerTestCase instead.
This makes a test database available and means that the local server does not
need to already be running.

The subclass `StaticLiveServerTestCase` ensures any static files are served
during testing (eg, any css / javascript); which may be useful for subsequent
tests. So we use that.

### ?? Running Functional Tests based on `StaticLiveServerTestCase`

When using `unittest.TestCase` we

- set up a local webserver to run in the background on port 8000 (`./manage.py
  runserver`)

- had a main block to run all tests defined in `./functional_tests.py`:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
```

- ran the test script was using `python functional_tests.py`

- and all tests accessed the URL for the site using "http://localhost:8000"

Tests based on `StaticLiveServerTestCase`

- automatically set up a webserver (running on a random port)

- can be found automatically by the django test runner

- are ran using the django-test runner

- access the URL for the site using `self.live_server_url`

So, no main() block is required when running the functional tests, and the
tests are ran as follows:

```
# to run FTs in ./functional_tests.py
./manage.py test functional_tests

# note the absence of the .py extension
```

### ?? Adding, Authorising, Logging-in users within Tests

To add a user:

```
# From the Django docs
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
user = User.objects.create_user('john', 'lennon@thebeatles.com', 'johnpassword')
```

Then in tests:

```
# where `self` is a subclass of `django.test.TestCase`
self.client.login(username="john", ...blah...)
```

To add a log-in page

- add `path("accounts/", include("django.contrib.auth.urls"))` to urlpatterns
- add a `login.html` file to `contented/templates/registration/`
- use Django's default login form in the html template
- add `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "home"` to `config/settings.py`
- there is no reason to add a 'view' function/class

To use the login page within the functional tests, either:

- go to `self.live_server_url + "/accounts/login/"`
- or follow a "Log In" button from the home-page (this should redirect to
  `<home>/accounts/login`)

### ?? Setting access-restrictions for a project

Options:
- add a config entry that indicates which projects are restricted
- add a database model for projects
- add a restrictions.yaml to the project-collection directory
- add an environment variable containing the names of restricted projects (and
  parse it into the config)

In the first two cases would need to do some manual work to ensure a project is
accessible (ie, tinker with the code for contented or in the admin for the site)

For now, added `RESTRICTED_PROJECTS = []` to config; plan to update this based
on env-vars or project-collection-associated config file

### ?? Test a user is redirected to login when accessing a restricted project

- Add a restricted project to `RESTRICTED_PROJECTS` using `@override_settings`
- Try to access that restricted project via it's URL
- Check for redirection (code 302 = redirection)
- Planned: Check that template for login is used (ie, login.html)
    - note the latter did not work; when using assertTemplateUsed, the
      testrunner claimed that no template was used at all (rather than the
      login.html template; that the latter template is used can be seen in the
      browser)
- Therefore checked that the redirection URL matches the login URL

## How to style the website using bootstrap

Bootstrap v5-beta1 is the latest version (as of 2021-01-10)

Add bootstrap to ./static folder of the `contented` app (rather than using
downloading each time the site loads)

```
wget \
  -O bootstrap.zip \
  https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v5.0.0-beta1/bootstrap-5.0.0-beta1-dist.zip
unzip bootstrap.zip
mkdir contented/static
mv bootstrap-5.0.0-beta1-dist contented/static/bootstrap
rm bootstrap.zip
```

Load the css into the `head` of the html files:

```
...
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link href="/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
...
```

Indicate that the bootstrap URL ("/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css")
used in the above is for a static file, rather than html. If a URL starts with
the `STATIC_URL` defined in `config/settings.py` (ie, "/static/") then the URL
is a static and will be loaded.

(Ensure that `django.contrib.staticfiles` is in the `INSTALLED_APPS`, which it
is by default)

Rather than coding the `STATIC_URL` ("/static/") into the URLs for static
files, you can use the 'static' template tag in any .html files (this will
prepend the `STATIC_URL` to filenames)

```
{% load static %}
...
<link href={% static "bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" %} rel="stylesheet">
```

Similarly, add this to the body of an .html file to load the bootstrap/popper
bundled javascript file:

```
<body>
...
  <script src="{% static 'bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js' %}"></script>
</body>
```

The static files shouldn't be served by django in production (django is slower
at this than nginx), so it's better to make a single directory where nginx can
deploy static files from. These files are collected into `STATIC_ROOT` by
django's `collectstatic` command. We set `STATIC_ROOT` to "{`base_dir`}/static"

```
# config/settings.py
...
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")
```

Then collect the static files together:

```
./manage.py collectstatic
```

## How to deploy to staging server

Want to run tests against staging site: `contented-staging.russlearnsweb.co.uk`

To run the functional tests against that site from local computer:

Define the `live_server_url` to be "http://contented-staging..." for the
functional tests during test setUp (obtain the URL from an env variable).

```
STAGING_SERVER=contented-staging.russlearnsweb.co.uk \
  python manage.py test functional_tests
```
